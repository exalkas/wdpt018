/**
 * 07 - Weather App
 *
 * Objective: Create a simple weather app that fetches weather information based on a user-inputted city and displays it.
 *
 * Instructions:
 *
 * Use an API like OpenWeatherMap or any other of your choice to fetch weather information.
 * Set up state to keep track of the city the user inputs and the weather data returned from the API.
 * Use useEffect to fetch the weather information whenever the city changes.
 * Display the fetched weather information, such as temperature, weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy), and so on.
 * Handle potential errors, such as if the city is not found or the API request fails.
 * Optional: Implement a loading state to indicate to users that the data is being fetched.
