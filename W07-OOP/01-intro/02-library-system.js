/**
 * Library System
Objective: Create a system that allows users to manage a collection of books and their borrowing status.

Structure each book as an object with the following properties:

id: A unique identifier for the book.
title: The title of the book.
author: The author of the book.
isBorrowed: A boolean indicating whether the book is borrowed or not. Default this to false.

Implement the following functionalities:

a) Add a Book to the Library:

Function name: addBook
Input: title, author
Output: Return the newly created book object.
Action: Add the book to an array representing the library. Ensure each book has a unique id.

b) Remove a Book from the Library:

Function name: removeBook
Input: id of the book to be removed.
Output: Return a message indicating success or failure of the operation.
Action: Remove the book with the given id from the library array.

c) Borrow a Book:

Function name: borrowBook
Input: id of the book to be borrowed.
Output: Return a message indicating success or failure of the operation.
Action: Update the isBorrowed property of the book with the given id to true.

d) Return a Borrowed Book:

Function name: returnBook
Input: id of the book to be returned.
Output: Return a message indicating success or failure of the operation.
Action: Update the isBorrowed property of the book with the given id to false.
